### Context

Nowadays, online educational platforms provide a vast amount of online courses. 
For self-learning beginners in Data Science, sometimes it's hard to choose an online lecture to start. 
This EDA intends to answer common questions when choosing a new study like **"Does a paid course provide higher quality than a free one?"** or **"Which platform is the most suitable for beginners?"**, 
and also to discover which online platform provides the highest educational quality.
